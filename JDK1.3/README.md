## Introduction

Released on May 8, 2000, JDK 1.3 brought several significant updates to the Java platform, focusing on performance improvements and enhanced functionality. This release introduced important features like the integration of the HotSpot JVM and the inclusion of new APIs to support debugging, directory services, and sound. It also marked the last Java version to officially support Microsoft Windows 95.

## Key Features
