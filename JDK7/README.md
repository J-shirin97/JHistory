# JDK 7 - Key Features and Enhancements

## Introduction

Released on July 28, 2011, JDK 7 was a major update that introduced significant language enhancements, JVM improvements, and library updates. Developed through thirteen milestones, JDK 7 delivered features that enhanced developer productivity, improved JVM support for dynamic languages, and extended file and concurrency utilities. It was developed under several JSRs, including JSR 292, JSR 203, and JSR 166.

## Key Features

### JVM and Performance Enhancements

- **Dynamic Language Support (`invokedynamic`)**

  - Added JVM-level support for dynamic languages through the new `invokedynamic` bytecode (JSR 292).
  - Facilitated the integration and performance of dynamic languages like Groovy, Scala, and JRuby on the JVM.
- **Compressed 64-bit Pointers (`-XX:+UseCompressedOops`)**

  - Reduced memory consumption for 64-bit JVMs by compressing object references.

### Language Features (Project Coin)

- **Strings in `switch` Statements**

  - Allowed `String` values to be used in `switch` statements for clearer and more concise code.
- **Try-with-Resources Statement**

  - Simplified resource management in `try` blocks by automatically closing resources like files and sockets.
- **Diamond Operator (`<>`)**

  - Improved type inference for generic instance creation, reducing verbosity in code.
- **Simplified Varargs Method Declaration**

  - Enhanced method declarations with varargs to suppress compiler warnings about unsafe operations.
- **Binary Literals**

  - Allowed integers to be expressed in binary using the `0b` or `0B` prefix.
- **Underscores in Numeric Literals**

  - Improved readability of large numeric literals by allowing underscores (e.g., `1_000_000`).
- **Multi-Catch Exceptions and Rethrowing with Improved Type Checking**

  - Enabled catching multiple exception types in a single `catch` block and improved type checking for rethrown exceptions.

### Library and API Improvements

- **Concurrency Utilities (JSR 166)**

  - Enhanced utilities in `java.util.concurrent` for parallel processing and thread management.
- **New File I/O Library (JSR 203)**

  - Introduced the `java.nio.file` package, supporting:
    - Multiple file systems.
    - File metadata and symbolic links.
    - Simplified file handling.
- **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**

  - Added library-level support for ECC algorithms, enhancing cryptographic capabilities.
- **Timsort Algorithm**

  - Improved sorting performance for objects by replacing the previous merge sort with Timsort.
- **Improved Graphics and Network APIs**

  - Added XRender pipeline for Java 2D, optimizing GPU rendering.
  - Support for new protocols like SCTP and Sockets Direct Protocol.

### Other Enhancements

- **XML and Unicode Updates**

  - Included upstream updates for improved XML processing and Unicode support.
- **Java Deployment Rule Sets**

  - Enhanced deployment capabilities for secure and controlled application deployment.
