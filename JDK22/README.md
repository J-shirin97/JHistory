## Key Features  

### Language Features  

- **JEP 456: Unnamed Variables & Patterns**  
  - Enhanced pattern matching with unnamed variables and patterns (`_`), simplifying the handling of unused data in deconstruction scenarios.  

- **JEP 447: Statements before `super(...)` (Preview)**  
  - Allowed initialization statements before calls to `super(...)` or `this(...)`, enhancing flexibility in constructors.  

- **JEP 459: String Templates (Second Preview)**  
  - Expanded capabilities for String Templates, allowing safer and more expressive dynamic string construction.

### JVM and Runtime Enhancements  

- **JEP 423: Region Pinning for G1**  
  - Improved the G1 Garbage Collector with region pinning, optimizing object locality for better performance in specific workloads.  

- **JEP 464: Scoped Values (Second Preview)**  
  - Continued refinement of Scoped Values, offering safer and more efficient alternatives to thread-local variables for immutable context sharing.

### Core Libraries and APIs  

- **JEP 454: Foreign Function & Memory API**  
  - Finalized the Foreign Function & Memory API, enabling seamless and efficient interaction with native libraries and off-heap memory.  

- **JEP 461: Stream Gatherers (Preview)**  
  - Introduced stream gatherers, enhancing the `Stream` API with more flexible and performant ways to aggregate data.  

- **JEP 457: Class-File API (Preview)**  
  - Provided a modern API for reading, writing, and manipulating Java class files, simplifying bytecode-level tasks.

### Developer Productivity  

- **JEP 458: Launch Multi-File Source-Code Programs**  
  - Enabled developers to compile and run multi-file source code programs directly from the `java` command, streamlining prototyping and scripting workflows.  

- **JEP 463: Implicitly Declared Classes and Instance Main Methods (Second Preview)**  
  - Enhanced prototyping with implicit class declarations and instance-based `main` methods, simplifying quick experimentation.

### Experimental and Incubating Features  

- **JEP 460: Vector API (Seventh Incubator)**  
  - Continued enhancement of the Vector API for SIMD operations, improving performance for data-parallel workloads.  

- **JEP 462: Structured Concurrency (Second Preview)**  
  - Refined structured concurrency, improving error handling and task management in concurrent programming.
