# JDK 1.4 - Key Features and Enhancements

## Introduction

Released on February 6, 2002, JDK 1.4 was the first Java release developed under the Java Community Process (JCP) as JSR 59. This version introduced several significant language and library improvements, focusing on regular expressions, enhanced I/O capabilities, and security enhancements. It also brought a new emphasis on standardization through various JSRs (Java Specification Requests).

## Key Features

### Language Changes

- **`assert` Keyword**
  - Introduced to support assertions for debugging and runtime validation (specified in JSR 41).

### Library Improvements

- **Regular Expressions**

  - Modeled after Perl-style regular expressions.
  - Enabled powerful text processing using the `java.util.regex` package.
- **Exception Chaining**

  - Allowed exceptions to encapsulate lower-level exceptions, improving error handling.
- **IPv6 Support**

  - Added support for Internet Protocol version 6, preparing Java for the next generation of networking.
- **Non-blocking I/O (NIO)**

  - Introduced a new I/O system (NIO) for scalable, non-blocking data transfers (specified in JSR 51).
  - Added features like buffers, selectors, and channels to simplify high-performance I/O.
- **Logging API**

  - Provided a robust logging framework to track application events (specified in JSR 47).
- **Image I/O API**

  - Added support for reading and writing images in formats like JPEG and PNG.
- **Integrated XML Parser and XSLT Processor**

  - Included JAXP for XML parsing and XSLT transformations (specified in JSR 5 and JSR 63).
- **Security and Cryptography Enhancements**

  - Integrated JCE (Java Cryptography Extension), JSSE (Java Secure Socket Extension), and JAAS (Java Authentication and Authorization Service) into the core platform.
- **Java Web Start**

  - Enabled the deployment of Java applications over a network.
  - First introduced in JDK 1.3 but formally included in the platform (specified in JSR 56).
- **Preferences API**

  - Provided a lightweight, persistent data storage API (`java.util.prefs`) for storing user and application preferences.
