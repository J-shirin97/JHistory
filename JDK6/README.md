# JDK 6 - Key Features and Enhancements

## Introduction

Released on December 11, 2006, JDK 6 marked a significant milestone in Java's evolution by simplifying naming conventions (dropping "J2SE" and ".0") and introducing major improvements in scripting language support, performance, and web service integration. Developed under JSR 270, this version continued to refine Java's platform capabilities for both developers and end-users.

## Key Features

### Language and Platform Enhancements

- **Scripting Language Support (JSR 223)**

  - Introduced a generic API for integrating scripting languages into Java applications.
  - Included built-in integration with Mozilla's JavaScript engine, Rhino.
- **Java Compiler API (JSR 199)**

  - Enabled Java programs to programmatically invoke the Java compiler, supporting dynamic compilation.
- **Support for Pluggable Annotations (JSR 269)**

  - Provided a standardized way to integrate annotation processors into the Java compiler.
- **JAXB 2.0**

  - Upgraded the Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) to version 2.0, including integration with the StAX parser for efficient XML processing.

### Library and API Improvements

- **Improved Web Services Support (JSR 224)**

- **JDBC 4.0**

  - Enhanced database connectivity with features like automatic driver loading and support for SQL exception chaining.
- **Swing Enhancements**

  - Integrated `SwingWorker` into the API for easier background processing.
  - Added support for table sorting and filtering.
  - True double-buffering for smoother rendering and elimination of gray-area artifacts.

### JVM and Performance Improvements

- **Dramatic Core and Swing Performance Gains**
  - Optimizations in synchronization and compiler performance.
  - New and upgraded garbage collection algorithms for better resource management.
  - Reduced application startup times.

### GUI and User Experience Enhancements

- **Built-in Table Sorting and Filtering**
  - Simplified working with data in tables with integrated sorting and filtering mechanisms.

### Platform Support

- **64-bit Mac OS X Support**
  - JDK 6 could be installed on Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) for 64-bit processors (Core 2 Duo and above).
  - Supported both 32-bit and 64-bit Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard).
