## Key Features  

### Language Features  

- **JEP 394: Pattern Matching for `instanceof`**  
  - Finalized pattern matching, simplifying type checks and casts by combining them into a single operation.  

- **JEP 395: Records**  
  - Finalized support for `record` classes, enabling concise and immutable data modeling.  

- **JEP 397: Sealed Classes (Second Preview)**  
  - Continued refinement of sealed classes, allowing developers to restrict which classes or interfaces can extend or implement a given type.

### JVM and Runtime Enhancements  

- **JEP 376: ZGC: Concurrent Thread-Stack Processing**  
  - Enhanced the Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) with concurrent thread-stack processing to reduce pause times further.  

- **JEP 387: Elastic Metaspace**  
  - Improved memory management by returning unused metaspace memory to the operating system, reducing overall memory footprint.  

- **JEP 390: Warnings for Value-Based Classes**  
  - Added warnings when attempting to synchronize on value-based classes to encourage best practices.  

- **JEP 396: Strongly Encapsulate JDK Internals by Default**  
  - Restricted access to internal APIs by default, promoting module-based development and improving application security.

### Core Libraries and APIs  

- **JEP 338: Vector API (Incubator)**  
  - Introduced an incubating API for vectorized computations, improving performance for mathematical and data-processing workloads.  

- **JEP 380: Unix-Domain Socket Channels**  
  - Added support for Unix-domain socket channels, enhancing inter-process communication capabilities.  

- **JEP 389: Foreign Linker API (Incubator)**  
  - Provided an API for interacting with native libraries, enabling safer and more efficient foreign function calls.  

- **JEP 393: Foreign-Memory Access API (Third Incubator)**  
  - Continued the development of the Foreign-Memory Access API for direct access to memory outside the Java heap.

### Tools and Platform Updates  

- **JEP 357 and JEP 369: Migration to Git and GitHub**  
  - Transitioned Java's source control from Mercurial to Git and moved the project repository to GitHub, modernizing development workflows.  

- **JEP 347: Enable C++14 Language Features**  
  - Allowed the use of C++14 features in the JDK's native code, aligning with modern C++ standards.  

- **JEP 392: Packaging Tool**  
  - Finalized the packaging tool for creating native installers, simplifying application deployment.  

---

### Platform Support  

- **JEP 386: Alpine Linux Port**  
  - Added support for running Java on Alpine Linux, though it remains experimental.  

- **JEP 388: Windows/AArch64 Port**  
  - Introduced support for Windows on ARM64 (AArch64) processors.

## Deprecations and Removals  

- **Ahead-of-Time Compilation and Graal JIT**:  
  - Removed support for AOT compilation and the Graal JIT compiler due to limited usage and maintenance overhead.
