# Java JDK Evolution Project

Welcome to the **Java JDK Evolution Project**, a comprehensive repository documenting the evolution of Java through its versions. This project aims to provide detailed overviews of Java Development Kit (JDK) versions, their new features, and associated JEPs (Java Enhancement Proposals). Each JDK version is meticulously documented to serve as a resource for Java developers, enthusiasts, and learners.
