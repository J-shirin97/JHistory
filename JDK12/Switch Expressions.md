# Switch Expressions in Java  

## Introduction  

Switch expressions, introduced in Java 12 as a preview feature (JEP 325), enhance the traditional `switch` statement by making it more concise, expressive, and versatile. The feature became a standard part of the language in Java 14. Switch expressions allow `switch` to be used not only as a statement but also as an expression, enabling it to return values and simplifying common use cases.

## Why Do We Need Switch Expressions?  

1. **Reduce Boilerplate**:  
   - Traditional `switch` statements are verbose, especially when handling multiple cases with similar logic.  

2. **Improve Readability**:  
   - Repetitive `break` statements in the old `switch` syntax often make code harder to follow and prone to errors.  

3. **Safer Code**:  
   - Traditional `switch` allows "fall-through" behavior, which can cause unexpected bugs if `break` statements are forgotten.  

4. **Flexibility**:  
   - Switch expressions allow `switch` to return a value, making it easier to handle data-driven logic.

## How We Managed Before Switch Expressions  

Before switch expressions, achieving similar functionality required verbose traditional `switch` syntax or conditional statements like `if-else`.  

### Example: Traditional Switch Statement  



```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int day = 2;
        String dayType;

        switch (day) {
            case 1:
            case 7:
                dayType = "Weekend";
                break;
            case 2:
            case 3:
            case 4:
            case 5:
            case 6:
                dayType = "Weekday";
                break;
            default:
                dayType = "Invalid";
        }

        System.out.println(dayType); // Output: Weekday
    }
}
```

Issues with Traditional Switch

1)    Requires explicit break statements.
2)   Verbose when multiple cases share the same logic.
3)    Cannot directly return a value from the switch construct.

#### Using Switch Expressions

Switch expressions simplify the syntax by allowing cases to return values directly, using -> for case actions. It eliminates the need for break statements and reduces the potential for fall-through errors.
Syntax
```java
result = switch (variable) {
    case value1 -> expression1;
    case value2, value3 -> expression2;
    default -> defaultExpression;
};
```

##### Example : Pattern Matching for String Inputs


```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String role = "admin";

        String accessLevel = switch (role) {
            case "admin" -> "Full Access";
            case "editor" -> "Edit Access";
            case "viewer" -> "View Only";
            default -> "No Access";
        };
        System.out.println(accessLevel); // Output: Full Access
    }
}
```

### Real-Life Scenarios :
1) ##### Data-Driven Logic:
        Use switch expressions to map user roles to access levels, as shown above.

2) ##### Enum Handling:
        Simplify logic for handling enum values, such as mapping weekdays to work schedules or months to financial quarters.

3) ##### Command-Line Parsers:
        Map input arguments or commands to specific actions in CLI applications.



### Advantages of Switch Expressions

1) #####     Conciseness:
        Eliminates boilerplate code like break statements.
        Handles multiple cases in one line using commas.

2) #####     Type-Safe:
        Ensures all cases return values of the same type.

3) #####     Eliminates Fall-Through Errors:
        No need for explicit break statements, reducing potential for bugs.

4) #####     Flexible and Functional:
        Can be used as both statements and expressions.


  ###     Conclusion

Switch expressions modernize the switch construct, aligning it with functional programming principles and improving readability, safety, and maintainability. By understanding its syntax and use cases, developers can write cleaner and more concise Java code while avoiding common pitfalls of traditional switch statements.
