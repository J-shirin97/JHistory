# JDK 1.2 - Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition

## Introduction

Released on December 8, 1998, JDK 1.2 marked a major milestone in the evolution of Java. This version was rebranded as Java 2, initiating the naming convention "J2SE" (Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition). It was a pivotal release that significantly expanded the Java platform, introducing numerous new APIs and features, and forming the foundation for the modern Java ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **`strictfp` Keyword**

  - Introduced for consistent floating-point computations across platforms.
  - Ensures uniform precision and rounding behavior for floating-point arithmetic. *(By JVM 17, this keyword is considered obsolete.)*
- **Swing Graphical API Integration**

  - Fully integrated into the core classes, replacing AWT for more advanced GUI components.
  - Enabled richer user interfaces with features like pluggable look-and-feel and lightweight components.
- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Compiler**

  - Sun's JVM introduced a JIT compiler, significantly improving runtime performance by translating bytecode into native machine code dynamically.
- **Java Plug-in**

  - Facilitated seamless integration of Java applets with web browsers.
  - Improved cross-browser compatibility and security for Java applications.
- **Java IDL (Interface Definition Language)**

  - An implementation for CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) interoperability.
  - Allowed Java applications to interact with systems developed in other languages.
- **Collections Framework**

  - Introduced a unified architecture for working with groups of objects.
  - Included fundamental interfaces (e.g., `List`, `Set`, `Map`) and classes (`ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `HashSet`) to simplify data management.
