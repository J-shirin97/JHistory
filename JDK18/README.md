# JDK 18 - Key Features and Enhancements  

## Introduction  

Released on March 22, 2022, JDK 18 introduced several updates aimed at improving developer productivity, runtime performance, and platform flexibility. This release included finalized and incubating features, such as a **Simple Web Server**, enhancements to the **Foreign Function & Memory API**, and **Pattern Matching for switch**. It also emphasized modernization by setting UTF-8 as the default character set and reimplementing core reflection using method handles.

## Key Features  

### Language Features  

- **JEP 420: Pattern Matching for `switch` (Second Preview)**  
  - Continued refinement of pattern matching in `switch` statements, enabling more concise and expressive data-driven control flows.  

---

### Core Libraries and APIs  

- **JEP 400: UTF-8 by Default**  
  - Standardized UTF-8 as the default character set for Java APIs, ensuring consistent behavior across different platforms and locales.  

- **JEP 408: Simple Web Server**  
  - Added a minimal HTTP server suitable for prototyping, testing, and ad-hoc development tasks.  

- **JEP 413: Code Snippets in Java API Documentation**  
  - Enhanced API documentation by including code snippets with syntax highlighting and automatic validation.  

---

### JVM and Runtime Enhancements  

- **JEP 416: Reimplement Core Reflection with Method Handles**  
  - Reimplemented core reflection (`java.lang.reflect`) to use method handles, improving performance and maintainability.  

- **JEP 421: Deprecate Finalization for Removal**  
  - Marked the finalization mechanism (`finalize()` method) for eventual removal due to its inefficiencies and modern alternatives like `try-with-resources`.  

---

### Experimental and Incubator Features  

- **JEP 417: Vector API (Third Incubator)**  
  - Further developed the Vector API for SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations, enhancing performance for data-parallel computations.  

- **JEP 419: Foreign Function & Memory API (Second Incubator)**  
  - Continued refining the API for safe and efficient interaction with native code and memory outside the JVM.  

---

### Platform and Networking Enhancements  

- **JEP 418: Internet-Address Resolution SPI**  
  - Introduced a service provider interface (SPI) for resolving internet addresses, allowing developers to customize DNS resolution.  

---

## Deprecations and Removals  

- **JEP 421: Deprecate Finalization for Removal**  
  - Deprecated finalization as part of a long-term effort to remove it in favor of more modern resource management techniques.
